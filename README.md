## Setting up development environment

### Prerequisites

- Node 22.9.0 or higher
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v9.11.0 or higher
- git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `pnpm install` to install the project dependencies.

## Git Workflow

- The `main` branch is the default branch.
- Commiting directly or merging to the `main` branch locally is not allowed.
- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
- Push the branch to the remote repository and create a pull request when ready for review.
- Addding `Closes #issue-number` in the pull request description or in any commit message will automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged.
